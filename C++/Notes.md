## C++

1. enum is a user defined data type which takes only the values defined by the user. For example, 

```C++
enum direction{North,South,East,West};

direction dir;
dir = South;
cout<<dir<<endl;//3
```

Used to have a stricter check over the possible values that a variable can undertake.

2. Defining your own namespace. What exactly is namespace.
3. Only one main function per namespace. There can be two if different namespace are defined. 

4. Faster i/o
5. Assignment operator is the only operator which can be overloaded but cannot be inherited.
6. Bitwise operators work with only integral data types like char\, int and long and not with floating point values.
7. Working of left shift and right shift bitwise operators.
